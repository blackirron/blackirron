Hi..  Samir Here...

B.Tech @ IIT Dhanbad
Building systems that actually work.

I’m obsessed with understanding how systems behave at the lowest level —
from Linux kernel internals and container runtimes
to databases, AI-driven applications, and high-performance backend systems.

I don’t just use tools. I break them down, rebuild them, and understand why they work.

🔬 Interests

Systems Programming & OS Internals

Containerization & Isolation Mechanisms

Backend Engineering (Python, MySQL)

Applied AI for Production Use-Cases

Data Structures & Competitive Programming

🚀 What I Build

Minimal Container Runtime
→ Process isolation, namespaces, cgroups, resource constraints

AI-Powered Restaurant Management System
→ Demand forecasting, backend automation, intelligent decision support

Backend Systems with Clean Architecture
→ Structured design, maintainable code, real-world deployment mindset

🧠 Engineering Philosophy

Understand before optimizing

Simplicity over unnecessary abstraction

Build from first principles

Make it production-thoughtful, not demo-level

📌 Current Focus

Deepening Linux & systems knowledge

Building AI that solves operational problems

Writing code that survives scale
